## Comprehensive Analysis and Implementation of Machine Learning Classifiers

This repository focuses on the implementation and comparative analysis of various machine learning classifiers using Python, including Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. The project aims to evaluate the performance of these classifiers on different datasets to understand their strengths and weaknesses. It includes tasks such as implementing MLPs with varying architectures and activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, and custom ELU), extending the CWRU Bearing dataset for MLP training, and performing regression analysis on the Weather in Szeged dataset using techniques like Least Squares (LS), Regularized Least Squares (RLS), and Weighted Least Squares (WLS). The project also involves training and evaluating decision tree classifiers, analyzing the impact of hyperparameters, applying ensemble methods like Random Forest and AdaBoost, and using Naive Bayes classifiers on the Heart Disease dataset with cross-validation analysis.

The project objectives are to compare the performance of different classifiers, analyze the impact of various hyperparameters, and understand the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier. This includes visualizing decision boundaries, evaluating MLP models with K-Fold and Stratified K-Fold cross-validation methods, and analyzing the differences between predicted and actual values in regression tasks. The project utilizes datasets such as a synthetic dataset for classification tasks, the CWRU Bearing dataset for fault diagnosis, and a weather dataset for regression tasks. By comparing the performance of these classifiers, the project provides insights into their applicability and effectiveness for various machine learning problems.
