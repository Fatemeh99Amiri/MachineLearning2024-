# MachineLearning2024

# Overview

Welcome to the Machine Learning course projects repository for the Spring 1403 semester at Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology. This repository includes all mini-projects assigned throughout the semester, each designed to deepen your understanding and expertise in machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm development. The repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for four mini-projects, each focusing on different machine learning areas such as supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and neural network implementations.

# Projects Summary and Deadlines

Detailed guidelines and requirements for each project are included in their respective directories. The important deadlines for the projects are as follows: Project 1 is due by 18:00 on Friday, April 17, 1403; Project 2 is due by 18:00 on Friday, May 28, 1403; Project 3 is due by 18:00 on Monday, June 20, 1403; and Project 4 is due by 18:00 on Monday, July 11, 1403. These deadlines ensure timely submission and adequate time for project completion and review.

# Project Overview

The projects are designed to help you visualize training and evaluation processes, generate datasets, perform hyperparameter tuning, extend and analyze datasets, extract features, train and evaluate models, compare different algorithms, and implement various machine learning techniques from scratch. Mini Project 1 aims to train and evaluate various classifiers and regression models using synthetic and real-world datasets, including tasks such as training and evaluating a linear classifier on a synthetic dataset, extending and preparing the CWRU Bearing dataset for MLP models, and performing regression analysis on the Weather in Szeged dataset using techniques like LS, RLS, and WLS. Mini Project 2 focuses on comparing the performance of different machine learning classifiers on various datasets, involving tasks like implementing MLP with different architectures, training and evaluating Random Forest classifiers, and applying Naive Bayes classifiers to the Heart Disease dataset with cross-validation. Mini Project 3 explores the impact of dimensionality reduction techniques on SVM performance, including implementing t-SNE, PCA, and LDA, evaluating SVM with different kernels, and using autoencoders for data denoising and SMOTE for addressing class imbalance. Mini Project 4 delves into reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the Wumpus World problem, with tasks such as implementing Q-learning, extending it with Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and evaluating agent performance based on rewards.

# Tools and Libraries

The primary tools and libraries used in these projects include Python, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, keras, gym, and pygame. Google Colab is used for running and sharing notebooks, providing an accessible platform for collaborative work. GitHub is employed for version control, enabling efficient management and sharing of code among contributors.
